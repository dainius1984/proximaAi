After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, offer buy now, pay later functionality through Afterpay, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale. Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers grow, so do our solutions. There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a significant, meaningful, and lasting business, and we are helping sellers worldwide do the same. Square is part of Block, Inc.

Our software provides a rich conversational interface that takes interactive client responses and feeds them into an intelligent reasoning engine. It then digitally automates business processes for identity verification, validating asset valuations and assessing credit worthiness, as an example, using its externalised and fully configurable rules based engine.​

Historically, banking leaders believed that infrastructure technologies were an asset for their financial institution because they were managed locally and could be customised. Form3 is changing this model and offering payments infrastructure as a service. A fully cloud native platform that is fully managed to lower costs across operations, infrastructure, security, upgrades, and change management.

Digital engagement has become a strategic priority for financial service providers, banks and fintechs, fighting for attention, relevance, value and differentiation in a world otherwise dominated by social media, sensationalism and video games. Whilst ease of use got us into digital it does not provide the route forward in a world where people need instant gratification, emotional connection and how to join the team; what are the rules, what’s winning? Who am I playing with and against? How am I doing? How’s everyone else doing? Ease of use caters for none of these needs. Enterprises and governments meanwhile have some enormous challenges on their hands, all of which demand customer engagement. COVID is demanding enormous amounts of community engagement to turn the corner. Banks are swimming in a sea of sameness and are being pursued by big tech. Energy companies and their customers need to get off carbon. Moroku uses game theory to provide instant gratification and feedback to customers as they go about their lives individually and collectively, building emotional connection and helping people understand and play the big games that matter. We start with the On Ramp design methodology that we use with our clients to clearly understand what winning looks like , where the win states are and the types of recognition, reward and feedback that are pertinent to the game and the players. We then procced to collaborate to build the gamified digital experience, wiring up the Moroku Odyssey Saas Platform into the technology solution to drive engagement. The initial game design includes a set of game rules, that defines the outcomes of various player behaviours. These are codified into the platform which is then connected to actual customer behaviour.
